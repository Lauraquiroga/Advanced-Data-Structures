# Advanced Data Structures     
Advanced Algorithms (COSC 520) - Assignment 2      
Author: Laura Quiroga (lquiroga)     

This project implements three comparable advanced data structures: AVL tree, Red-Black tree, and Treap. It also includes a numerical comparison of their performance in terms of time complexity for the search and insert operations.

## Setup instructions   
Follow these steps to run the project:
1. **Clone the project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lauraquiroga/Advanced-Data-Structures.git
   cd Advanced-Data-Structures
   ```
2.  **Install dependencies**           
   Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.     
   Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended version for the virtual environment: Python 3.12.7).       

   Install requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt file.       
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Run the project**       
   Run the project from the root folder.       
   ```bash
   python main.py # or use python3 main.py if needed
   ```
   This will run the simulation with the small dataset included in the data folder (dataset10.json).          

   After the execution, the results will be saved in the data/results folder and you will see the plots showing the run time complexities.
           
   To use the 1M dataset or a custom one, place your file in the data folder and update the filename in main.py in the main() function.
                
   If you want to run the project with a different number of simulation steps (variations of sizes in the dataset), update the n_steps parameter in the initialization of the Benchmark() object in the main.py file.     
           

5. **Run the unit tests**            
   To run the test cases use the following command.       
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests # or use python3 -m unittest discover -s tests if needed
   ```
